# Command line support in python programs
I have gotten into the habbit of adding command line support to most of the python programs I write. The [argparse(https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html)] library is _great_ for this. I can go away from a program for months or even years and run the program with the `-h` flag to immediately see how to use it, including documentation for required and optional parameters. Adding command line support with argparse is a great way to put a bow on the project.
